    "[Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) (VAE) are a popular model that allows for unsupervised (and semi-supervised) learning. In this notebook, we'll implement a simple VAE on the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary goals of the VAE (and auto-encoders in general) is to reconstruct the original input. Why would we want to do that? At first glance, such a model seems silly: a simple identity function achieves the same thing with perfect results. However, with an autoencoder, we can learn a compresesed representation in a smaller latent space, allowing us to learn features and structure of the data. Autoencoders are composed of two arms, the **encoder** and **decoder**, which convert values from the data space to the latent space and vice versa, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, since we're simply reconstructing the original input, we do *not* necessarily need labels to do our learning, as we have in previous examples. This is significant, as labels are often far more expensive to acquire than raw data, often prohibitively so. VAEs therefore allow us to leverage abundant unlabeled data. That said, VAEs are also able to take advantage of labels when available as well, either in a completely supervised or semi-supervised setting. Altogether, autoencoders can achieve impressive results on tasks like denoising, segmentation, and even predicting future images."

Since we're dealing with a *variational* autoencoder, we attempt to model the *distribution* of the latent space given the input, represented by $q(z|x)$. This isn't immediately obvious in the code implementation, but we assume a standard Gaussian prior on this distribution, and our encoder returns the mean and variance (actually log-variance) of this distribution. We use log-variance because our model returns a real number, while variances must be positive.\n",

Beceause $x$ is binary data (black and white pixels), we will use a Bernoulli distribution. Our generative neural network will learn the mean of this Bernoulli distribution for each pixel we want to generate. Another viewpoint: if our neural network outputs $\\hat{x}_j$ for pixel $j$, it means we believe that the pixel will be white with that probability.\n",
    "\n",

Reconstruction loss: Our generator produces parameters to a Bernoulli distribution that is supposed to represent $p(x | z)$; because we assume that $z$ is the latent representation of an actual data point $x$, we can measure how well we achieve this goal by measuring the _likelihood_ of $x$ according to that Bernoulli distribution. Another way of thinking of this is that we can measure how similar our reconstructed image is to our original image. The measure of similarity we use is cross-entropy: we think of our model as classifying each pixel as black or white, and we measure how good the classifier is using the classic sigmoid cross-entropy loss.\n",

    "2. [KL Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence): Because this model is **variational**, we also include a KL penalty to impose a Gaussian prior on the latent space.

    "<sub>*[1] The primary purpose of TensorFlow is to construct a computation graph connecting Tensors and operations. Each of these nodes must be assigned a unique name; if the user does not specify one, a unique name is automatically generated, like 'Placeholder_2', with the number at the end incrementing each time you create a new node of that type. Attempting to create a node with a name already found in the graph raises an error.*</sub>\n",

In the Coding Environments notebook ([00B](https://github.com/kevinjliang/Duke-Tsinghua-MLSS-2017/blob/master/00B_Coding_Environments.ipynb)), it was mentioned that code from previously run cells persists. As such, if we're programming interactively and want to rebuild our graph after some updates, the new updated nodes we want to add collide with the names from our previous run, throwing an error. Why didn't we have to worry about this before? In the past, we haven't been naming our variables, so TensorFlow has been giving the nodes new unique names every time we update the graph and adding them to the collection of nodes from previous runs; the old nodes are never called, so they just sit there. However, TF-Slim does name the variables it generates, thus causing the problem. We can solve this by creating a new graph object before we define our computation graph, so every time we want to make modifications to the graph, we start anew.*</sub>\n",
